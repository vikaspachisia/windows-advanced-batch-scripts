# windows-advanced-batch-scripts
The set of batch files available here provide:
1. A Framework within which custom solutions can be built (explained via design below)
2. A resuable code that caters to many common build requirements
3. A library module for some specific tasks (e.g. version management in c++)

Not all of the above is available in every batch file. But I hope these batch files will solve most of build use cases while the code can be used as a reference code to achieve tough tasks in batch script files.
